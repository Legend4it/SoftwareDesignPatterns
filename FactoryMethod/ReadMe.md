## Factory Method
# Description: 
Defines an interface for creating objects but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.
# When to use: 
When the exact type of the object isn't known until runtime or when you want to decouple object creation from its usage.
# Why: 
Improves flexibility and reusability of code by isolating the object creation logic.
